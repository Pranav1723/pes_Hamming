Hamming code generator for error detection and correction
# Hamming Code Generator

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a Hamming code generator. Hamming codes are a class of error-correcting codes used in digital communication and data storage systems. They can detect and correct single-bit errors in transmitted or stored data.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical and educational example of a Hamming code generator implemented in Verilog. Hamming codes are known for their simplicity and effectiveness in error detection and correction. By exploring this implementation, you can gain insights into how error-correcting codes work at the hardware level.

## Key Features

- **Hamming Code Generation**: The Verilog code generates Hamming codes for a given data word, including the necessary parity bits.
  
- **Error Detection**: The generated Hamming codes allow for the detection of single-bit errors.

- **Error Correction**: In the presence of a single-bit error, the code can correct the error and recover the original data.
